As of April 2012 fr3X is now officially included in Fedora Linux 15,16,17,18
fr3X is also in the Red Hat EPEL repos (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux).
To install on Fedora simply type "yum install fr3X" as root.
It is also included in the FreeBSD ports tree.

Introduction:

	Problems may occur during the compilation process of fr3X. If
you do have a problem, please check http://github.com/fr3X/fr3X1.2/wiki
which has instructions on compilations. If you still need help please gather 
as much information about the error (*FULL* output of "configure and "make") 
and join #fr3X on freenode or EFNet. 

BUGS:
Please submit bugs here: http://github.com/fr3X

	Several script writers tend to hang in the #fr3X on EFNet to
distribute their work to others. http://www.fr3x.ca/scripts  is a great place 
where scripts can be found.  You can also check out the scripting forum at the
previously mentioned forums site.

	Some features will only work with certain servers -- IRCUMODE and
/4OP for example. Therefore, servers such as UnderNet, DalNet, and NewNet,
to name a few, will not respond to the user modes given. Scripts can cause
problems as well, usually due to bugs within the script. If there is a
known bug in the client, please contact the appropriate people, panasync
or any of the non-idling ops in #fr3X. If the bug can be reproduced
faithfully, then we have enough to determine how it can be resolved.


	Please check out the wiki at http://www.github.com/fr3X/fr3X1.2/wiki 
if you should have any troubles compiling.  A number of common mistakes and problems
users run into are posted in the FAQ and sometimes on the Forums as well.

Compiling fr3X:

In order to compile fr3X you need to do the following: (Optional steps
are marked with an asterisk, "*")

  1) Enter the fr3X directory tree; this is the most important step.
     Executing configure outside the tree is now possible, for example:

     # mkdir obj-i586-mandrake-linux
     # cd obj-i586-mandrake-linux
     # ../configure --prefix=/usr --with-plugins

  2) Run the GNU configuration script, "configure". It should find
     whatever it needs for the compilation of fr3X, such as system
     includes, ncurses, Tcl, and locations of important files. There are
     options that can be given to "configure". "configure --help" will detail
     all of them. Using at least "configure --with-plugins" is recommended
     if you plan on using one or more of the many plugins that are
     distributed with fr3X. Add "--with-gtk" if you have gtk and gnome-libs
     and would like a graphical client. Add "--with-tcl" if you want Tcl script
     support on i386 systems (Note: most users do not need this). tcl.o for
     other architecures may be available on fr3X FTP sites. The source code
     for tcl.o is not publically available.
      
* 3) "include/config.h" may need tweaking if you intend to change the
     default server list. To change, locate "DEFAULT_SERVER" and remove the
     original default servers and add as many as you please (These will
     be appended to the "/usr/local/lib/bx/ircII.servers" and "~/.ircservers"
     list). Alternatively, you can run "make bxconf" and use the graphical
     configuration utility to change many of fr3X's options.

  4) Execute "make" inside the fr3X directory. If any error messages are
     shown (Error, *not* Warning messages!!!) that you are unable to resolve
     on your own, seek help. "README" has more information on where you can go
     for help.

* 5) Edit "include/defs.h". On some systems, configure may not properly
     determine one or two definitions ("#define foo"). Search for
     offending defines which cause make not to proceed compiling.
     Usually, there should be a "#define" or "#undef" located on the line
     make has shown. A reversal of the definition (change "#define" to
     "#undef", or vice versa). Go on to step 6 once you have completed
     this step. If problems still persist, see "README" for information on
     where you can go for help. Note: DOING THIS STEP IS NOT RECOMMENDED.
     If "configure" fails to properly define something for whatever reason,
     PLEASE REPORT THIS AS A BUG to the current configure script maintainer
     (see "README" for details), rather than trying to edit "include/defs.h"
     by hand. 

* 6) Debugging information may be left into the compiled binary, so a
     "strip source/fr3X" solves the rather large size seen previously.
     However, "make install" (Step 7) should strip the binaries for you.

  7) Execute "make install". This should install the fr3X binary to
     "/usr/local/bin". Commonly, users may not have superuser access, thus a
     refusal ("permission denied" message) will occur. If you still insist on
     using "make install" to install fr3X, it is required that you change
     the installation path defined in step 4 by using
     "configure --prefix=/home/johndoe", for example, or use
     "make install_local" to install the binary to your home directory.
     However, it is recommened that you use the "--prefix=" method if you wish
     to have a full fr3X installation with all of the help files installed.

* 8) It is not a requirement to use function-filled scripts with fr3X,
     because the aim of fr3X is to create a scriptless client, or more
     appropriately, a client less dependant upon scripts. With the development
     of fr3X, scripts will become quickly outdated due to the
     incompatibility caused by new commands, hooks, or hardcoded replacements
     for a function in the script. This is merely a warning.
