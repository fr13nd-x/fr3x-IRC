fr3X-1.1-Final Readme file by  <fr13ndx>
======================================================

fr3X is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client fr13ndx. fr3X was originally based on ircII 2.8, but is currently
based on the ircii-EPIC4 releases by Jeremy Nelson.

fr3X was originally started as a script by Trench and HappyCrappy
for the popular UNIX IRC client ircII. Around Christmas of 1994 the
script was patched directly into the client by panasync. 


The new client will be based upon the final release of EPIC4 and will exclude
a great number of the old features such as support for OS/2 and GTK which was
very old and bloated plus there were problems with the gtk client causing
quite a hit to the CPU.  The upside is that the client will be pulled back
into a sane code base.  Less bloat and overhead is always good for you the
user.

For persons interested in becoming involved in the new project please visit
our forums website at EFnet #fr3X.

A special thanks to panasync.
